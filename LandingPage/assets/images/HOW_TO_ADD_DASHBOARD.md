# How to Add Your Dashboard Screenshot

## Quick Steps:

1. **Take a screenshot of your dashboard** (the one you showed me)
   - Make sure it shows the Dashboard Overview with stats
   - Best resolution: 1920x1080 or 1366x768

2. **Save the screenshot as**: `dashboard.png`

3. **Place it in this folder**: 
   ```
   LandingPage/assets/images/dashboard.png
   ```

4. **Refresh the landing page** - Your dashboard will appear animated in the hero section!

## Screenshot Tips:

✅ **DO:**
- Capture the full dashboard with all stats visible
- Use good quality (PNG format preferred)
- Show real data (makes it look authentic)
- Make sure UI is clean and no personal info visible

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use blurry or low-resolution images
- Include sensitive customer data
- Crop too much - show the complete dashboard

## Current Screenshot Location:

The screenshot you showed me displays:
- Today's Sales: ৳0 (0 orders)
- Monthly Sales: ৳18,603 (19 orders)
- Monthly VAT: ৳510
- Stock Alerts: 2 low stock
- Total Due: ৳1,600 (2 customers)
- Daily Sales Trend chart
- Inventory Health stats

**This is PERFECT for the landing page!** 🎯

## Alternative: Use from Your Running App

If you want to grab it directly from the running application:

1. Open your POS dashboard at `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`
2. Press `Windows + Shift + S` to open Snipping Tool
3. Capture the main dashboard area (exclude browser chrome)
4. Save as `dashboard.png` in the images folder

**The landing page is already configured to use `assets/images/dashboard.png`**

Just add the file and you're done! 🚀
